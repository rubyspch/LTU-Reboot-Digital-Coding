    Task 3.5.3b​

    We are going to be using an array of objects provided as a simple shopping cart example.​
​
    We need to be able to work out which items cost between 2 price points. So for example, we need the cart to be returned by which products cost more than £2 but less than £5.

    1. Create a function that has 3 arguments “cart”, “lowPrice” and “highPrice”​
    2. Create an empty array called arrItems at the start of the function.​
    3. Loop through each item of the array​
    4. If the price value is higher than or equal to the lowPrice and lower than or equal to the highPrice push to arrItems​
